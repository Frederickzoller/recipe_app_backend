# The OG Recipes API Documentation

## Introduction

Welcome to The OG Recipes API documentation. This API allows you to manage recipes in a simple and efficient manner. It provides endpoints for retrieving all recipes and creating new recipes.

## Base URL

The base URL for all API endpoints is:

```

```

## Authentication

Currently, this API does not require authentication. However, it's recommended to implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms in a production environment.

## Error Handling

The API uses standard HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of requests. In case of an error, the response will include an error message in the following format:

```json

  "detail": "Error message describing the issue"
}
```

Common error codes:

- 400 Bad Request: Invalid input data
- 404 Not Found: Requested resource not found
- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected server error

## Rate Limiting

Currently, there are no rate limiting policies in place. However, it's recommended to implement rate limiting in a production environment to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage of the API.
